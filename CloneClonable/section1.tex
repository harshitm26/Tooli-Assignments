\section{Modifier \label{modifier}}
To define clone the clone method of `Object` class has to be overridden. The `clone` method implemented by `Object` class is \textit{protected}.The child class can extend `clone` method using \textit{public/protected} modifier. We cannot use \textit{private/package protected} because it reduces the visibility of inherited method and gives compilation error.
