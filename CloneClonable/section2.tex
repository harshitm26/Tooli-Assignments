\section{`CloneNotSupportedException` \label{cloneNotSupportedException}\cite{Suresh, Oracle}}
When creating objects with `clone` method we need to extend the cloneable interface. Otherwise the compiler gives `CloneNotSupportedException`. Note, that `CloneNotSupported` is a checked exception and therefore, we use keyword `throws` in clone method when we use the clone method of the parent class.
% Detailed explanation is given in Section \nameref{section:inheritance}.
