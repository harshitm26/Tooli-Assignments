\section{Scope of Work and Expected Output}
\begin{itemize}
\item We propose to build a mini-compiler (toy implementation) which will support the basic functionalities of Java language with the above proposed functionality.
\item Making policies for handling the type-deduction for return type in functions when inheritance has to be taken care of while object type deduction.
\item Policies for unification of different types in return statements.
\item In some cases, types cannot be deduced in compile time for example
\insertcode{"Scripts/code4.java"}{}
In this case ‘a’ could be Dog or Cat and this depends on ‘b’. Such cases have to 
be carefully studied and need to be reported appropriately with 
warning/errors.
