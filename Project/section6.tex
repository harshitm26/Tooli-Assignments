\section{Proposed plan of work and techniques}
We plan to study the corresponding features existing in contemporary languages as mentioned above. 
For implementation purpose we plan to use one of the possible two approaches: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Study and extend some of the existing open source compilers specifically developed for studying compiler design like: Jastadd, Polyglot. 
\item  Develop a mini java compiler from scratch with the above proposed functionalities. 
\end{itemize}
The role of team members would be decided as we proceed with the project.
