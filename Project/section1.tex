\section{Abstract}
In Java, the type of a variable must be explicitly specified in order to use it. However, with our knowledge of type-inference and type-unification, usually we can deduce the types of variables as well as return types of functions (although it is not always possible to deduce the type). For this purpose we propose the use of auto keyword in Java. This would help developers to focus on the logic rather than on things which the compiler can itself deduce. The feature of auto keyword for type-deduction of variables has already been included in the latest C++11 standard. Further, in the proposed C++14 standard, automatic deduction of function-return-type has been included.
