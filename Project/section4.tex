\section{State of Art}
Currently, Java supports no such feature. In Java, the variable type of the variable and the return type of functions have to be explicitly mentioned at the time of variable/function declaration. However, the C++ language specifications have supports leaving the type deduction up to the compiler whenever possible in certain situations. The C++11 standard supports the keyword auto for variables which allows automatic type deduction for variables at compile time. Hence, at the time of variable declaration, the compiler deduces the type of the variable by looking at the value being assigned to it. Further, the new C++14 standard extends the usage of the keyword auto to function (as well as for lambda function) return-type-deduction. On similar lines, C\# standard currently supports the var keyword for automatic type deduction of variables. But, a necessity in both of the implementations is that the variable has to be initialized at the time of declaration. Another necessity is that if the function return type deduction has to be done by the compiler, then the function definition needs to accompany the function declaration.
